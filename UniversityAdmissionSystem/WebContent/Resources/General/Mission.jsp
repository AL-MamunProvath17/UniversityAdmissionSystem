<h3 align="center">University Mission</h3>
<p align="justify">ALIANT University adheres to the purposes for
which the Charter of 1650 was granted: "The advancement of all good
literature, arts, and sciences; the advancement and education of youth
in all manner of good literature, arts, and sciences; and all other
necessary provisions that may conduce to the education of the youth of
this country" In brief: ALIANT strives to create knowledge, to open the
minds of students to that knowledge, and to enable students to take best
advantage of their educational opportunities. To these ends, the College
encourages students to respect ideas and their free expression, and to
rejoice in discovery and in critical thought; to pursue excellence in a
spirit of productive cooperation; and to assume responsibility for the
consequences of personal actions. ALIANT seeks to identify and to remove
restraints on students' full participation, so that individuals may
explore their capabilities and interests and may develop their full
intellectual and human potential. Education at ALIANT should liberate
students to explore, to create, to challenge, and to lead.</p>
