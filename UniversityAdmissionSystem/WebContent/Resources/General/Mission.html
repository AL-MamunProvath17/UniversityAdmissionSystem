          <h3 align="center">University Mission</h3>
           <p align="justify" >ALIANT University adheres to the purposes for which
                           the Charter of 1650 was granted: “The advancement of all good
                           literature, arts, and sciences; the advancement and education of youth
                           in all manner of good literature, arts, and sciences; and all other
                           necessary provisions that may conduce to the education of the … youth of
                           this country….” In brief: ALIANT strives to create knowledge, to open
                           the minds of students to that knowledge, and to enable students to take
                           best advantage of their educational opportunities. To these ends, the
                           College encourages students to respect ideas and their free expression,
                           and to rejoice in discovery and in critical thought; to pursue
                           excellence in a spirit of productive cooperation; and to assume
                           responsibility for the consequences of personal actions. Harvard seeks
                           to identify and to remove restraints on students’ full participation, so
                           that individuals may explore their capabilities and interests and may
                           develop their full intellectual and human potential. Education at
                           ALIANT should liberate students to explore, to create, to challenge,
                           and to lead.</p>
