<p align="justify">There is more to life on campus than studying and
passing exams. You will develop as an individual, gain insights into
your core beliefs, develop interests in sports and arts, and make
lifelong contacts and business networks. Canadian and US universities
have active student societies, clubs and sports teams for players of all
abilities to help you reach your true potential.</p>

<h3>Health care</h3>

Center and then see the doctor or nurse by making an appointment. You
should familiarize yourself with the requirements and process before you
schedule an appointment. All our students have separate personal health
insurance coverage.</p>

<h3>Student services</h3>
<p align="justify">All universities and colleges have a Student
Services department, usually with a student center offering a range of
services such as sports and fitness facilities, a bookshop, games rooms,
lounges where you can relax between class, and social programming.
Support offered may include personal counseling, career development, and
student welfare. All the universities we work with also have
international offices where helpful staff can address your personal
needs as an international student.</p>

<h3>Facilities for worship</h3>
<p align="justify">In India , religious freedom is absolute, so you
may practice your faith wherever and however you choose. Most
universities have a chapel or campus ministry where you can spend time
in quiet reflection and prayer. These facilities are generally
interfaith and welcome people of all religious and spiritual
backgrounds.</p>

<h3>Sports</h3>
<p align="justify">Sporting activities play a major role in Indian
universities and Indian universities. Even if you do not take part,
regular Indian football, basketball or baseball games are important
social events on campus. Your university may offer a wide variety of
other sports, including volleyball, soccer, swimming and tennis. There
are three main ways to participate in sports at North Indian
universities:</p>

<h3>Social life</h3>
<p align="justify">Student clubs and organizations Take the
opportunity to join student clubs and organizations at Alliant
university. Clubs offer many different activities - some are
academically-focused and others are purely social. Many universities
have clubs that focus on international cultures. Joining a club is a
fantastic way to meet other students who have similar interests. It is
recommended that you join no more than 2 or 3 clubs, so as to not lose
focus on your studies. Whether you like playing a musical instrument,
outdoor adventure, or debating current events, you will most likely find
a club for you.</p>

<h3>Cultural activities</h3>
<p align="justify">Your university or college in North India may
host plays, art exhibitions, dance performances, live music, debates,
town hall meetings, and other cultural activities on campus. Attending
events like these are another way to truly experience Canadian and
Indian life and culture, and have a great time!</p>
